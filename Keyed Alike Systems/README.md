In certain situations, it is common for many locks to share the same key. These are called "Keyed Alike Systems". These can be found everywhere, in key switches, cabinet/drawer locks, RV compartment locks, elevator fire overrides, fleet vehicles, etc. Many of these keys are readily available to the public, and are perfectly legal to own.

If you use them to gain access to property without express permission of the owner, it is likely to classify as breaking and entering. Don't be a jackass, use these keys wisely. I take no responsibility for what you do with these keys.

Below is a table breaking down every key on my pentesting keyring. Expect more to be added, as I have an addiction to keys.

| Key Marking | Key Name | Key Works On | Notes |
| :---------: | :------: | :----------: | :---: |
| 222343 | Linear Keypad Key | Used on many Linear access control keypads. | |
| 2642 | Yale NYC Fire Service Key | Used for the fire service override in many elevators in NYC. | |
| 84 16120 | DoorKing Key | Opens essentially every DoorKing telephony access control system made after 1997. (The ones with the "DKS" logo.) It's common for these units to have an override button near the postal switch (second key on the front panel). If the postal switch is not present, it is also possible to manually short the postal switch terminals with a wire loop. Look at the User Manual of the model to be bypassed for the switch/SW/PS and common/COM/GND terminal numbers. | [Find Your DoorKing Model](https://www.doorking.com/telephone/) |
