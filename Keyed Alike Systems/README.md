# Keyed Alike Systems

In certain situations, it is common for many locks to share the same key. These are called "keyed alike". These keyed alike locks can be found everywhere, in key switches, cabinets, drawers, RV compartments, elevator fire overrides, fleet vehicles, construction/farm/utility vehicles, panels with keyed latches, lockboxes, handcuffs, etc. In addition, some "keyed different" locks also have a master key, to which they are all keyed alike. Many of these keys are readily available to the public, and are perfectly legal to own.

In some places, these keys may be legally considered similarly to lockpicks, and rules such as "suspicious activity while carrying burglary tools" or "crossing a specific border while in possession of burglary tools" may apply. For these situations, it's a good idea to have a good reason for owning them ready. I mainly carry my keyring as a conversation piece, and usually people will ask me to see if any of their stuff opens with them. At that point, it's a tool for a budding penetration tester. If you're in an area where lockpicks and such are just generally illegal, that explanation probably won't help.

If you use these keys to gain access to property without express permission of the owner, that's breaking and entering. Don't be a jackass, use these keys wisely. I take no responsibility for what you do with these keys. Some of these are fun (E-1 and ClubCar), some of them are scary (Ford 1284x), and some are downright dangerous (CAT key). All of them will get you in trouble if you're a jackass. Disclaimer over.

Below is the table breaking down every key on my pentesting keyring. Expect more to be added, as I have an addiction to keys.

| Key Marking | Key Name | Key Works On | Notes |
| :---------: | :------: | :----------: | :---: |
| 16120 | DoorKing Key | Opens essentially every DoorKing access control system made after 1997. (The ones with the "DKS" logo.) It's common for these units to have an override button/switch near the postal key switch (key near the middle of the front panel). If the postal key switch is not present, it is also possible to manually short the postal switch terminals with a wire loop. Look at the User Manual of the model to be bypassed for the switch/SW/PS and common/COM/GND terminal locations. | [Find Your DoorKing Model ("Installers")](https://www.doorking.com/) |
| 222343 | Linear Key | Used on many Linear access control systems. It's common for these units to have an override button/switch near the postal key switch (key near the middle of the front panel). If the postal key switch is not present, it is also possible to manually short the postal switch terminals with a wire loop. Look at the User Manual of the model to be bypassed for the postal lock terminal locations. | [Find Your Linear Model ("Products")](https://www.linearproaccess.com/) |

| Ford (S) | Ford 1284x Fleet Key | Works on some Ford fleet vehicles. This includes many police fleets, and by extension some auctioned off police vehicles. Some cab companies are known to use auctioned off Ford police fleets, so this may work for those as well. | [2020 Ford Police/Service Fleet Brochure](https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/brand_ford/en_us/brand/resources/general/pdf/brochures/20_Police_Brochure_Spds_MR.pdf) |
| Smith & Wesson | S&W Standard Handcuff Key | Works on a lot more than handcuffs. Used for jewelery boxes, [some magnetic gun locks](https://youtu.be/n-dQj8N196g?t=78), and more. It [does not work for all handcuff keys in all countries](https://youtu.be/3OWMzbRvgkY?t=47), but I plan on [making](https://imgur.com/gallery/j4ZrjrZ) the [TOOOL Ultimate Handcuff Key](https://youtu.be/KHpwAYTY6NE?t=2299) from it, which should open almost all of them. I'll probably try the [rotary tool method](https://youtu.be/TU16wDMSXE8?t=304) first, but only if I can get it [really close to the official specifications](https://imgur.com/OVkkmAQ).

In addition to the above keys, my keyring also has a wire loop made from a bent, insulated paper clip and electrical tape.
