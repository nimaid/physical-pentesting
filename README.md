# physical-pentesting
A safe place for me to put my physical penetration testing notes.

If you use the stuff here for something stupid/illegal, that's on you. I personally enjoy practicing on my own property, or property I have permission to practice on. I can't tell you how many times I've bumped/picked a house lock for a friend who forgot their keys, the info here should only be used in those situations.

If you gain access to property without express permission from the owner, that is considered breaking and entering in most places. Even if you only "test" to see if you can gain access with no malicious intent, it is still likely considered B&E if the owner did not expressly give you permission. If you really want to see if you can bypass some security measure, this is a situation where asking permission instead of forgiveness is wise.
